# About

<p>This chatbot was made for a co-op project back in 2016 with the Computer Help Desk at UVic. It filters for specific keywords
and if these keywords are found, it counts how many words are in the users input that matches. The purpose of this project was
mainly for me to learn how to interact with and host a database. XAMPP was used to host a database locally. The project was done in about a span of 3 days. The idea for this project was that it would allow the Help Desk Consultants to ask the Chatbot any work-related problem and have it quickly provide an answer.

The database is not included for confidentiality.
